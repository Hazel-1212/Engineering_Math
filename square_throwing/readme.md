## Abstract

The square is randomly thrown on the x-y plane with its center fixed on the y axis. 

And Y and θ are independent.

## Objectives

The goal is to get the E[qn] and E[W] via conducting the simulation for the large enough number of times.

- In Task 1, Y and θ are uniformly distributed. Figure 1 is created to show qn, the sum of Bernoulli random variable ak, for k=1, 2…n. 

- Task 2 holds a difference from Task 1. θ is still uniformly distributed, yet Y is not. 

- Task 3 requires finding the expected value of W, which is the area of square that below x axis. 

- Merge all the program in main code NYCU-113511170.py.

## Python Code

- NYCU-113511170.py : main program
- figure01.py : Task 1
- figure02.py : Task 2
- figure03.py : Task 3
- verify_area.py : 

    *To verify if E[W] obtained from figure3.py is correct.*

    *The file is not for simulation but for direct computing the double integration.*
