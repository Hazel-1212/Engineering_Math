## Objectives

The goal is to get the E[qn] and E[W] via conducting the simulation for the large enough number of times.

## Python Code

- NYCU-113511170.py : main program
- figure01.py
- figure02.py
- figure03.py
- verify_area.py : 

    *To verify if E[W] obtained from figure3.py is correct.*

    *The file is not for simulation but for direct computing the double integration.*
